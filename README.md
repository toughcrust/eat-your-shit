#### Overthink and let come

Overthink and let come: faire circuler la pensée \(analyse / synthèse, insufflation / expiration, ...\) pour passer d'un sentiment vague "it kinda feels right" à une décomposition minutieuse des résonances dans les différentes strates de la conscience \(pensée, émotions, logique, etc ...\).

Bénéfique pour moi et les autres: quelles sont nos intentions respectives ? En particulier celles qui sont rampantes. Ex: espérer la séduction amoureuse en externalité positive à l'introspection et au partage de ses résultats. Ca peut parfois devenir le but principal sans qu'on s'en aperçoive =&gt; dés-alignement entre pensée consciente et motif réels =&gt; Aïe !

Your Grandmother Was Right, But She Didn’t Know Why  
I have no shame in using the vocabulary someone uses \(light nourishment\) for Google searches but to express myself I allow to use a word that resonates more.

Kinda cool, kinda scary. But mostly cool: if you take the time to investigate, you WILL know better than about everyone

Be good at is what at what you are willing to be criticized about.  
On most things people are content with having knowledge they hold "true": it serves them. Prove dem wrong and then get annoyed.

On questions such as "Is there a God ?" we like to go straight and try an answer cause it's fun. But if the question actually matters, it's much more useful to figure out the kinds of answers you may get, how it would shake your beliefs and what you'd do from there. For example, even if there was indeed an old guy who had all power and knowledge, would you accept to submit to him ? As for me, I ask why should I ? It does not make sense. So yes the question is still funbut I don't bas the core of my existential beliefs on its answer \(at least not completely\).  
**Better question maybe: "What's the meaning of life ?": whatever simple sentence proposed, I cannot imagine my mind not questionning it \(and having pleasure in rebelling\) thus expressing a desire of liberation from a given meaning =&gt; There is a logic to solve here =&gt; Article MEDIUM "What is the meaning of the meaning of life ?"**

I can't imagine any definitive answer on such a topic not to be mind blowing. And when you have a look at the best movies out there, I find that what they do the best is firing infinite possibilities \(more questions than answers\) in your mind. Somehow I can't help but see in popular movies and video games \(or children playing\), a small scale re-play of what is the core creativity of the universe. Like clues or puns.
