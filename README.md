Cautionary notes from the author:

  But well I value shit you know (TO BE CONTINUED) ...
  **EMBRACE POOP OR BURN IT WITH FIRE !!!**
  I need not fearful guidance but guidance to sublimate fear

## Trying to be honest about writing this stuff

for me but also to make something of my exentialist over-questioning. Transform a plague into something that can help me get laid more easily with girls I have an intellectual connection with (and a physical attraction)

## Does not feel good

Sometimes I write stuff that I want to remember cause it feels important
But I don't like reading it.
I've come to have the intuition I'll need to re-write it later.

## It all starts with depression

What you know should give up pleasure does not.
Then you start to think a lot more about getting more of what you actually have.
Even more because you don't want to waste what is still precious in your eyes.
So you start to dig topics healthy people don't pay much attention to: food, sleep, communication, etc ...

More on that as a problem later:
- when people tell you overthinking makes you depressed
- but they don't understand overthinking IS the coping mechanism to depression
- but they might not be totally wrong and you have to know when to stop

## Strippin' bloggers

Not talking about half naked micro bloggers.

pour ce qui est d'écouter ce que des gens en apparences loufoques ont à dire:
"I feel you're being honest, I need to have a feeling what you experience but I certainly don't need your mental models that try to make sense of what you experience, at least in a first time."

Your Grandmother Was Right, But She Didn’t Know Why
This annoying blogger is right, but she is lost in pseudo science

If you take the time to investigate, you WILL know better than anybody else. Only question is: Does it feel like it's worth it ?
=> just like what we're good at is what we are willing to be criticized about.
On most things people are content with having knowledge they hold "true": it serves them. Prove dem wrong and then get annoyed.

## Cut the crap

**Que dit le corps ?**
Je ressens un refus viscéral de plus en plus présent de ne m'engager émotionnellement dans rien qui ne soit pas essentiel à ma vie. C'est tellement bon de refuser le stress => savoir débusquer le stress et le bouter hors du corps

Droit au but / **Avancer en trace directe**:
<ajouter citation de la horde du contrevent>
- Le combat renforce 
- L'hésitation, le louvoiement font déperir

**Garder l'objectif en vue**
Plus les moyens d'atteindre un but sont proches de l'esprit du but, mieux c'est:
- J'aime pas les lois coercitives, je les préfères incitatives
- Je préfère un combat doux à un entraînement sur sac de frappe
- Eviter certains aliments plutôt que de prendre un médicament

**"Pourquoi est-ce que je m'emmerderais à faire ça"**?

1. Fuck un boulot qui ne soit pas simple & kiffant
2. Tant qu'il y a de la place pour la bonne humeur et la coopération (à savoir 99% du temps) faisons ça
3. idem 1. et 2. appliqué à ma relation à moi-même

**Care & Do**
- care is a call for action that need not last
- doing frees from caring => do more to care less

**No crap in the first place**
Vivre selon ses propres règles / dans sa propre utopie (a minima honnêteté radicale). Après je n'en ai rien à faire si ça ne se passe pas comme je le rêve. Je n'abandonne rien de ce qui est important, mais je me fous de ce que je ne maîtrise pas (Et qu'est-ce que je maîtrise ?).

## Dialog with myself

Is there a meaning to life ?

Spoiler alert: No there is not :smile: 
Seriously if life was something else than a random bunch of events, we would know it by now.
Please fix !

Can't answer your question (which looks rhetorical anyway), but I'd like to mention the following thinking discipline that has proven invaluable (to me):

When facing a challenging question, be sure to state clearly:
- How will the fact to have an answer (or the absence of it) impact you ? Which hopes, beliefs, assumptions about yourself / life may be shaken ? In other words, What utility do you derive from what you currently hold true concerning this issue ? **[1]**
- With what kind of method do you consider tackling the issue ? Will you engage it with a highly "rational" mind, from an intuitive perspective, with a Trump-ish "I don't care about reality" attitude, looking how successful people do it, etc... ?  **[2]**

**[1]** It's good to do this exercise to the point you where what you list becomes very intimate, maybe even shameful. Because that's where you finally get to what really matters to you (and the real shame is that we tend to avoid this kind of self-reflection). It's incredible how much what we do / think about is influenced by the usefulness we can derive from the result (I'd even say totally). Even more striking is how we conceal to ourselves the fact we are obsessed with utility. To illustrate these two points, consider how the belief in "god" is:
- not really satisfying as an answer: ok, a dude who looks a hell like us humans created us. but if you really want to think just a little bit more: where the hell is HE/SHE coming from ???
- super useful in daily life in so many aspects

The book `The moral animal` was a climax for me in that regard. A lot to criticize in the approach but stuff you can't unsee (a bit what I feel about Kafka's `The castle`)

**[2]** I advise them all ! I call it "defragmentation" and consists in looking at something from all the points of view that you can (as a powerful tool, look for different mindsets you have experienced in your life, how you'd have reacted as a kid, etc...)

So, from a practical point of view I'd advise you to deepen those questions.  
My guess is that you'll realize your initial question actually emcompasses a lot of stuff and you'll end up creating multiple issues :)

I should myself probably create different issues to develop more on those...

S'il y a un "jugement dernier", Je m'attends à des excuses ou des justifications pour la peine endurée. Pourquoi j'accepterais d'une quelconque divinité ce que je n'accepte pas de mes congénères ? Le cas échéant c'est de la manipulation, de l'hypocrisie et "on" veut que je sois moins digne que ce que je peux être. 
Pourquoi je dis ça ? Parce que du coup **quel est le sens d'un soi-disant "sens de la vie" quand je n'imagine pas mon sens critique, si je prends la peine de le consulter, l'accepter purement et simplement** ?

A few enthusiasting ideas for the meaning of our life as a human:
- we are the genitals our our technology, enabling it to live and prosper (it is actually a more robust form of "life") a bit like in the novel `Spin`
- we are meat harvested by ungodly gods (hello `Sausage party`)

That's another way to say: if you're given a meaning to life, or more accurately a cause for your existence, does it fullfill you ? Do you still feel the search for "meaning of life" should be a central question ? **Maybe somehow the most reasonable thing to do is to invent a meaning to our lifes**.

**I can't imagine any definitive answer on such a topic not to be mind blowing. And when you have a look at the best movies out there, I find that what they do the best is firing infinite possibilities (more questions than answers) in your mind**.
I sometimes feel life and what come after may be influenced by what you believe. Its boundaries are drawn as you go forward, like in a video game.

Talking about video games, would you play for long an easy game that does not challenge your abilities, blow your mind ? I think that's the same for life
